    notes: "Not big on beef? You can still have this luscious burger, just swap the same amount of beef for organic ground turkey or chicken. If you have extra organic chicken breasts on hand, simple cut them in thirds and grind in your food processor until finely chopped. Two popular brands of gluten-free sweet potatoes fries are Alexia and Ore Ida.",
